## What is this project about? </br>
**CPP Modules** are nine projects that taught me all I needed to learn about how Object-Oriented Programming works and the beautiful programming language of C++.</br></br>

## Biggest Challenges üí™

Before taking this set of modules, I had a limited understanding of Object-Oriented Programming. However, now I can confidently say that I understand how it works and I have grown to love it! One of the biggest challenges I faced was learning the syntax for classes in C++. At first, concepts such as polymorphism, abstract classes, interfaces, and inheritance were quite confusing, but I have come to appreciate their usefulness and find them very practical to apply.

## List of modules:
  | Module | Description |
  |---|---|
  | [Module 00](Module_00) | This first module of C++ is designed to help you understand the specifics of the language when compared to C. Time to dive into Object Oriented Programming! |
  | [Module 01](Module_01) | This module is designed to help you understand the memory allocation, reference, pointers to members and the usage of the switch in CPP. |
  | [Module 02](Module_02) | This module is designed to help you understand Ad-hoc polymorphism, overloads and orthodox canonical classes in CPP. |
  | [Module 03](Module_03) | This module is designed to help you understand Inheritance in CPP. |
  | [Module 04](Module_04) | This module is designed to help you understand Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes and interfaces in CPP. |
  | [Module 05](Module_05) | This module is designed to help you understand Try/Catch and Exceptions in CPP. |
  | [Module 06](Module_06) | This module is designed to help you understand the different casts in CPP. |
  | [Module 07](Module_07) | This module is designed to help you understand Templates in CPP. |
  | [Module 08](Module_08) | This module is designed to help you understand templated containers, iterators and algorithms in CPP. |
  | [Module 09](Module_09) | This module is designed to help you understand the containers in CPP. |
